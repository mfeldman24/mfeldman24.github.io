## Here are a couple paragraphs about myself: 
I am a first year at Lehigh and I am math major. I tried to learn how to code last year through a coding program called, "Girls Who Code," but I was extremely unsuccessful. Though I found coding very difficult I still think it's interesting and impressive to do. Of course I have tried to hack my way though my senior year quizzes, but I never quite got to that level of coding. I am not the most technologically savy, so this type of learning takes me a while to pick up, but I am intrigued nonetheless. 
My time here is spent mostly studying for calculus exams which can get a little tedious, but I still have found some time to enjoy myself. I have signed up for the ultimate frisbee club, an investment managament club, and my personal favorite: *chocolate club*. I'm excited to eventually particpate in these clubs in person, but for now there are just a few zoom meetings to figure out the logistics for the year. I can't wait for frsibee club to start up because I loved playing ultimate frisbee with my track and field team in high school, and I think my skills imporved greatly over the past year. I am still more excited though, to sit around and eat chocolate with new friends. I hope to eventually find some intramurual teams for either soccer or basketball, but I doubt that they will be starting anytime soon. I played soccer my freshman year of high school, but quit to participate in my school's fall drama. Though I have enjoyed theatre for the past three years, now I much prefer to go outside and play soccer. I also love to play basketball with friends; I was in a 3-v-3 basketball tournament my senior year. Despite being knocked out after the first round I can produdly say I was the only on my team to score a point. I can't wait to go out and start playing again as soon as I can.

This scatter plot shows a medium correlation between GDP per capita and self reported life satisfaction in those countries. The data is provided by the Worldbank and shows that on average countries that have a higher GDP have higher ratings in life satisfaction.

This line chart demonstrates the distrubtion between 2015 and 2019 of undergraduate students in the top three most popular colleges at Lehigh. The data was provided by Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics. A few obious conclusions are that the College of Arts and Sciences is the most popular, this is most likely because of the wide variety of majors offered while the engineering college has a few specialized majors.
## Per Capita Consumption of 8 Ounce Serving of Soft Drinks in 2019

This bar graph demonstrates the distribution of the consumption of soft drinks between the leading consuming countries. The data used was from, "Bevarge-Digest Fact Book 25th Edition" which is updated annually. This fact book takes into consideration a variety of things like brands, companies, and anything non-alcholic beavarge related. They collect this data by analyzing profits and sales of the largest soft drink companies. Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from this data, especially taking into consideration things like obesity rates. The majority of the analysis completed uses statistics of countries, information on brands, and the history of these types of drinks.

## History of Coca-Cola
Here is a short a timeline of how the Coca-Cola brand came to be the popular, well known drink it is today. The timeline explores primarily who was a part of the process that boosted the brand's popularity. I chose to explore the history of the Coke brand because it is one of my favorite drinks and I've always been curious about who played a role in starting such a well known brand.

## Self Reported Mask Wearing
![Mask Wearing](https://github.com/mfeldman24/Mask-Wearing/blob/master/Distribution%20of%20Mask%20Wearing.png?raw=true)
This infogrpahic represents data used from the article, "Most Americans say they regularly wore a mask in stores in the past month; fewer see others doing it" written by Ruth Igielnik. [Here is the original data set](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ft_2020.06.23_masks_02.png?w=539). The data was collected through surveys sent by the Pew Research center to a variety of demographics across age, race, and political affiliation. The inspiration to collect this data started when stores and small businesses began to re-open. This created curiosity about how citizens self report how often they wear masks and how citizens report seeing other people wear masks. By surveying a variety of demographics Igielnik was able to draw a few conclusions from the data. For example, college educated citizens wore masks more often than those without degrees and older, more vulnerable people wore masks more often than younger generations. 
The most important finding to me is the difference between Republicans and Democrats. On average, it was found that Democrats wore masks in stores more often than Republicans. More importantly there is a spectrum that shows Conservative Republicans were least likely to report wearing masks often while Liberal Democrats were most likely to report wearing masks often. This could pose an answer to my question: Does political affilation correlate to mask wearing? The data shows that the more right winged a citizen is, the less likely they are to report wearing masks most of the time while the more left winged citizens are the converse. Even though there are risks to trusting self reported data, I think based on the use of other demographics the data is reliable. Despite the other demographics showing interesting findings like the effect of age and education gaps, I think the most important implication is about political affliation, especially with the election in just a couple of months. One could draw a conclusion that the data shows which groups of citizens are more willing to make sacrifices in order for COVID-19 deaths to decline.
