I am a first year at Lehigh and I am a math major. I tried to learn how to code last year through a coding program called, “Girls Who Code,” but I was extremely unsuccessful. Though I found coding very difficult I still think it’s interesting and impressive to do. Of course I have tried to hack my way though my senior year quizzes by searching through the code for answers, but I never quite got to that level of coding. I am not the most technologically savvy, so this type of learning takes me a while to pick up, but I am intrigued nonetheless.
My time here is spent mostly studying for calculus exams which can get a little tedious, but I still have found some time to enjoy myself. I have signed up for the ultimate frisbee club, an investment managament club, and my personal favorite: *chocolate club*. I'm excited to eventually particpate in these clubs in person, but for now there are just a few zoom meetings to figure out the logistics for the year. I can't wait for frsibee club to start up because I loved playing ultimate frisbee with my track and field team in high school, and I think my skills imporved greatly over the past year. I am still more excited though, to sit around and eat chocolate with new friends. I hope to eventually find some intramurual teams for either soccer or basketball, but I doubt that they will be starting anytime soon. I played soccer my freshman year of high school, but quit to participate in my school's fall drama. Though I have enjoyed theatre for the past three years, now I much prefer to go outside and play soccer. I also love to play basketball with friends; I was in a 3-v-3 basketball tournament my senior year. Despite being knocked out after the first round I can produdly say I was the only on my team to score a point. I can't wait to go out and start playing again as soon as I can.
## Roller Coasters: Height and Revenue

These visualizations demonstrate where the top ten tallest roller coasters are in the world and includes a bar graph of annual revenues for 2018. The largest annual revenues correlate more towards the size of the park rather than the height of the roller coaster. The map shows that the tallest roller coasters are primarily in the North East. This is interesting that four out of the top ten roller coasters are in the North East of the United States. This data was collected through Tripsavvy and a variety of sources for the annual revenue of each park.

These two column charts demonstrate where Lehigh students prefer to go to parties depedning on what gender they identify as and what groups they are a part of at Lehigh. The most obvious conclusions from these graphs are that students a part of Greek life contribute the most to party prefernce while Varsity Athletic Teams contribute the least. This is an accurate reflection of students' social lives based on what groups they are a part of and how flexible their schedule is.
## Top 10 Tallest Roller Coasters
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1V7fRRo1tFMzEvapZiVfawxgfXhj8ifcn" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
This map displays the top ten tallest roller coaster drops in the world. The data is provided by Tripsavvy to create a definite list of the best roller coasters to ride as adrenaline junkies. The map shows that the majority of the coasters on this list are in the US on the east coast. Unfortunately, New Jersey, the location of Kingda Ka, has not had the best track record in regards to amusement parks. Action Park in New Jersey has the most dangerous rides in the world. According to Jade Budowksi there have been at least 8 deaths at Action Park. Does New Jersey have fewer regulations that allow the tallest roller coaster to be built there? Kingda Ka also has the most delays from mishaps and construction. Should roller coasters be this tall? Are more lives being put at risk for no reason? We should be asking if taller roller coasters are more dangerous if other criteria should be considered like quality of material.
## Top 20 Cycling Countries

This map displays the top 20 best countries for biking. The data is provided by Wired. It’s interesting to observe that countries with the least amount of car traffic like Coppenhagen and Amsterdam are the best places for cycling. According to Bloomberg Citylab, Amsterdam has been working on cutting down on car access around the city. The conclusion can be drawn that countries with more paths for walking and biking are better for cycling than countries with heavy car traffic.
## Gas Prices From WTI Compared to Local Retail Prices
![WTI vs Retail Prices](https://github.com/mfeldman24/mfeldman24.github.io/blob/master/GDP_and_Life_Satisfaction__Life_satisfaction_in_Cantril_Ladder_(World_Happiness_Report_2019)_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)
This scatter plot shows West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices and the U.S. regular grade gasoline prices during a four-month period in the Fall of 2016. There is a strong positive correlation between them, as WTI prices increase retail prices also increase. This data was provided by The US Energy Information Administration. It may seem obvious that there would be a positive correlation, it is important to question how closely related these two factors are. This scatter plot shows that retail gas prices increase more, percentage wise, than WTI oil prices. This tells us that the price increases are not proportional and we are paying more for gas than it is worth. This data is also taken from southern states where gas is the lowest in the country, it would be interesting to compare this to Pennsylvania prices followed by California prices. I would assume that as prices around the country grew, they would be even less proportional than southern states due to higher living costs and minimum wage rates.
## GDP and Life Satisfaction Per capita

This scatter plot shows a medium correlation between GDP per capita and self reported life satisfaction in those countries. The data is provided by the Worldbank and shows that on average countries that have a higher GDP have higher ratings in life satisfaction.
## Lehigh Undergradatuate Enrollment 2015-2019
![Lehigh Undergrad enrollment](https://github.com/mfeldman24/mfeldman24.github.io/blob/master/Lehigh_Undergrad_Enrollment_Arts_&_Sciences_Engineering_Business_chartbuilder%20copy.png?raw=true)
This line chart demonstrates the distrubtion between 2015 and 2019 of undergraduate students in the top three most popular colleges at Lehigh. The data was provided by Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics. A few obious conclusions are that the College of Arts and Sciences is the most popular, this is most likely because of the wide variety of majors offered while the engineering college has a few specialized majors.
## Per Capita Consumption of 8 Ounce Serving of Soft Drinks in 2019
![Soft Drink Consumption](https://github.com/mfeldman24/mfeldman24.github.io/blob/master/Per_Capita_Consumption_of_Soft_Drinks_in_2019_8_Ounce_servings_per_year_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)
This bar graph demonstrates the distribution of the consumption of soft drinks between the leading consuming countries. The data used was from, “Beverage-Digest Fact Book 25th Edition” which is updated annually. This fact book takes into consideration a variety of things like brands, companies, and anything non-alcoholic beverage related. They collect this data by analyzing profits and sales of the largest soft drink companies. It is important to take into consideration things like obesity rates. There is a correlation between high rates of obesity and the amount of soft drinks consumed per capita. The majority of the analysis completed uses statistics of countries, information on brands, and the history of these types of drinks.

## History of Coca-Cola
Here is a short a timeline of how the Coca-Cola brand came to be the popular, well known drink it is today. The timeline explores primarily who was a part of the process that boosted the brand's popularity. I chose to explore the history of the Coke brand because it is one of my favorite drinks and I've always been curious about who played a role in starting such a well known brand.

## Self Reported Mask Wearing
![Mask Wearing](https://github.com/mfeldman24/Mask-Wearing/blob/master/Distribution%20of%20Mask%20Wearing.png?raw=true)
This infographic represents data used from the article, “Most Americans say they regularly wore a mask in stores in the past month; fewer see others doing it” written by Ruth Igielnik. Here is the original data set. The data was collected through surveys sent by the Pew Research center to a variety of demographics across age, race, and political affiliation. The inspiration to collect this data started when stores and small businesses began to re-open. This created curiosity about how citizens self report how often they wear masks and how citizens report seeing other people wear masks. By surveying a variety of demographics Igielnik was able to draw a few conclusions from the data. For example, college educated citizens wore masks more often than those without degrees and older, more vulnerable people wore masks more often than younger generations. The most important finding to me is the difference between Republicans and Democrats. On average, it was found that Democrats wore masks in stores more often than Republicans. More importantly there is a spectrum that shows Conservative Republicans were least likely to report wearing masks often while Liberal Democrats were most likely to report wearing masks often. This could pose an answer to my question: Does political affiliation correlate to mask wearing? The data shows that the more right winged a citizen is, the less likely they are to report wearing masks most of the time while the more left winged citizens are the converse. Even though there are risks to trusting self reported data, the use of other demographics makes the data reliable. Despite the other demographics showing interesting findings like the effect of age and education gaps, I think the most important implication is about political affiliation, especially with the election in just a couple of months. One could draw a conclusion that the data shows which groups of citizens are more willing to make sacrifices in order for COVID-19 deaths to decline.
