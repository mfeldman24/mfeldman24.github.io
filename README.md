## Here are a couple paragraphs about myself: 
#### I am a first year at Lehigh and I am math major. I tried to learn how to code last year through a coding program called, "Girls Who Code," but I was extremely unsuccessful. Though I found coding very difficult I still think it's interesting and impressive to do. Of course I have tried to hack my way though my senior year quizzes, but I never quite got to that level of coding. I am not the most technologically savy, so this type of learning takes me a while to pick up, but I am intrigued nonetheless. 
#### My time here is spent mostly studying for calculus exams which can get a little tedious, but I still have found some time to enjoy myself. I have signed up for the ultimate frisbee club, an investment managament club, and my personal favorite: *chocolate club*. I'm excited to eventually particpate in these clubs in person, but for now there are just a few zoom meetings to figure out the logistics for the year. I can't wait for frsibee club to start up because I loved playing ultimate frisbee with my track and field team in high school, and I think my skills imporved greatly over the past year. I am still more excited though, to sit around and eat chocolate with new friends. I hope to eventually find some intramurual teams for either soccer or basketball, but I doubt that they will be starting anytime soon. I played soccer my freshman year of high school, but quit to participate in my school's fall drama. Though I have enjoyed theatre for the past three years, now I much prefer to go outside and play soccer. I also love to play basketball with friends; I was in a 3-v-3 basketball tournament my senior year. Despite being knocked out after the first round I can produdly say I was the only on my team to score a point. I can't wait to go out and start playing again as soon as I can.

## Self Reported Mask Wearing
![Mask Wearing](https://github.com/mfeldman24/Mask-Wearing/blob/master/Distribution%20of%20Mask%20Wearing.png?raw=true)
This infogrpahic represents data used from the article, "Most Americans say they regularly wore a mask in stores in the past month; fewer see others doing it" written by Ruth Igielnik. [Here is the original data set](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ft_2020.06.23_masks_02.png?w=539). The data was collected through surveys sent by the Pew Research center to a variety of demographics across age, race, and political affiliation. The inspiration to collect this data started when stores and small businesses began to re-open. This created curiosity about how citizens self report how often they wear masks and how citizens report seeing other people wear masks. By surveying a variety of demographics Igielnik was able to draw a few conclusions from the data. For example, college educated citizens wore masks more often than those without degrees and older, more vulnerable people wore masks more often than younger generations. 
The most important finding to me is the difference between Republicans and Democrats. On average, it was found that Democrats wore masks in stores more often than Republicans. More importantly there is a spectrum that shows Conservative Republicans were least likely to report wearing masks often while Liberal Democrats were most likely to report wearing masks often. This could pose an answer to my question: Does political affilation correlate to mask wearing? The data shows that the more right winged a citizen is, the less likely they are to report wearing masks most of the time while the more left winged citizens are the converse. Even though there are risks to trusting self reported data, I think based on the use of other demographics the data is reliable. Despite the other demographics showing interesting findings like the effect of age and education gaps, I think the most important implication is about political affliation, especially with the election in just a couple of months. One could draw a conclusion that the data shows which groups of citizens are more willing to make sacrifices in order for COVID-19 deaths to decline.
